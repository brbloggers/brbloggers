“Fox came to me to apologize after he admitted to the fabrication. He
described how and why he started tampering with data. The first time it
happened he had analyzed a dataset and the results were just shy of
significance. <b><i>Fox noticed that if he duplicated a couple of cases
and deleted a couple of cases, he could shift the p-value to below
.05.</i></b> And so he did. Fox recognized that <b><i>the system
rewarded him, and his collaborators, not for interesting research
questions, or sound methodology, but for significant results</i></b>.
When he showed his collaborators the findings they were happy with
them—and happy with Fox.”
